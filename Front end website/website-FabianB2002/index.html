			<h2>Space as we know it</h2>
			<p>
				Space is a word used to describe an area or region. When it comes to outer space it is not so easy to define.
				Space is a vast region that goes way beyond our planet's atmosphere. It begins around 100 km above sea level
				Outer space and the universe are almost the same however outer space refers to the area between planets and 
				the universe is the area around planets .
