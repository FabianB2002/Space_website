# Beauty of Space 

My website is all about ***Space***.
 
It has 4 pages: 
- [The home page](website-FabianB2002/index.html)
- [A page about planets](website-FabianB2002/Planets.html)
- [A page where you can search about a star](website-FabianB2002/Stars.html)
- A page which can show you the [NASA Picture of the day](website-FabianB2002/NASA.html) 

The home page introduces the subject of space and the universe as well as portray a few facts.

The planets page contains images of all planets and an animation occurs when you hover over the planet showing a **factfile** about that planet.

The stars page uses an api from [API Ninja](https://api-ninjas.com/api/stars) that allows you to enter the name of a star into a search bar and get back information about a star.

The NASA PotD page uses an API that is able to obtain the picture of the day from the [NASA PotD official website](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html).

Each link in the top right of every page has a redirect animation which plays for 2 seconds and is responsive to any size change.

This website is meant for teenagers and space enthusiasts, while the home page is quite child-friendly in terms of the animations, the information displayed throughout the rest of the website may not be understood or used by children.

Using media queries all pages have been adapted so when changed to mobile size it is still responsive and looks nice.

## Issues with code

On the stars page the JavaScript creates an error in the console window even though it still returns the desired value

On the NASA picture page, certain days do not display a picture due to different author rights
